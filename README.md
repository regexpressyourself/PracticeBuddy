# Practice Buddy
_a web app to help practice guitar and bass, written in React.js_

## Components

### Modes

Practice Buddy will allow show all seven modes and their corresponding scales. The modes can be listed as intervals or direct notes.

### Chords

Practice Buddy will map out chords for you. You can chose Ebm7, and the notes (and their intervals) will be displayed

## Improvements

A log of Nashville-system based charts would be incredibly useful in the long term, but may require user accounts, or user upload functionality that will not be in v 1.0 of Practice Buddy.
